          <p> Potracheno is a wasted time tracker.</p>

          <h4>Potracheno</h4>
          <p>It works similar to a normal bugtracker. However, instead of keeping track of time spent on <i>solving</i> anissue, it focuses on time wasted on <i>living with it</i>.</p>

          <h4>Potracheno</h4>
          <p>Spent an hour working around a bug everybody else knew about? Post it here!</p>

          <h4>Potracheno</h4>
          <p>Spent half a day hitting your head against the keyboard, then <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/482129/280449">reverted the change
          </a>? Definitely post it here!</p>

          <h4>Potracheno</h4>
          <p>Browse issues, propose solutions, and maybe one day the cost a targeted refactoring will be outweighted by the cost of lost time.
             Even in the eyes of management.</p>
